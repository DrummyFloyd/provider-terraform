# provider-terraform demo sample

This example demonstrates `XSubnet` consistent XRD abstraction with multiple
`Composition` implementations.

It illustrates the transition from [Terraform Workspace](00-tf-only/composition.yaml)
to the [mixed scenario](01-tf-and-native/composition.yaml) and finally full migration to [Crossplane-native Managed
Resources](02-native-only/composition.yaml)
